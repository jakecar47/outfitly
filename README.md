## Tech Stack
Front-end: Swift & SwiftUI will be used for the front end design of Outfitly

Back-end: Still TBD however, we can use Azure App Service and Azure Functions along with Azure CosmosDB to store data. // Azure would be a better choice than Firebase for an app that will store a lot of user data

## Functionality
Similar to Instagram, users will be able to post pictures of new outfits and AI will be used to define item pricing, purchase location, and where to find the best deals on clothes present in the picture.
On the discover page, users will be able to see other users posts along with clothing ads, ai generated outfit ideas, and outfits worn by influencers.
On the create page, users will be able to create, save and share outfits with friends.
